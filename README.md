> Home cooked meal recipes. 
This repo hosts the assets used to build the Black Rose website.

### Background
Ever since I can remember, I've enjoyed cooking and sharing recipes with loved ones by stuffing their faces with food I made. I've
always envisioned owning a cozy cafe or trattoria like kind of restaurant some day in the future, that would serve breakfast, lunch and 
early dinner, however the uniqueness of it would come down to the menu i would offer. The menu would only contain recipes I have self-made 
or created by myself over the years that I've had stored in a old manuscript book, the menu would not contain regular meals served in common restaurants
today, and because of that the name "BlackRose" is what I would call it.

A black rose is technically a very dark shade of red, purple or maroon, it's color can be deepened by adding black ink to water in vase. I would say 
unlike any other rose, it is unlikely, unusual and definitely a hidden gem, which is the similar idea I'v always had for my little restaurant
it would be a hidden gem for many to find wholesome meals and experience a sense of home. 

Given that my BlackRose restaurant dream is yet to be realised, I present to you BlackRose the website, it will serve as a way to still share
my self-made recipes with everyone not just my loved one until such a time that I can make these meals for the general public, it will also 
serve as an upgrade or civilised version of my old manuscript book, and hopefully one I won't be able to lose, as I've done before with the old.

And lets not forget BlackRose is also because I consider myself to be a rose and because I'm a black woman the idea of a black rose
resonates more with me.

BlackRose recipe site is not your regular recipe website, the only recipes to be found are those made by me, I'll not be instructing on how to 
pouch an egg, you should already have the skills to.

## UX

### User stories
- As a subscriber looking for inspiration on a home cooked meal,
while battling busy schedules and family life, I would like to easily read a recipe.

- I often struggle to cut down the measurements of ingredients for a recipe that serves more than
one person. I would like the ability to reduce the serving number and automatically provide the
correct measurements.

- I hardly cook without a recipe, and when I do I never know what to pair certain foods with, 
I would appreciate a recipe that has an entire meal documented.

- What if I would like to find a similar meal around or near me, because I might to feel like cooking 
today?

- As a user I would like the ability to online purchase the ingredients I need for the recipe, and
not have to worry about writing a list and going to my local grocery store.

- I'm new to cooking, I often have no idea what some of the ingredients are or what they look like,
often making it a mission for me to locate in a grocery store.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible for users searching for recipes to 
have a clean look with no clutter or information over load by having a user-friendly and minimalist
design.

### Scope
For the users i wanted to provide them with easy to read recipes that I have created, in a way lessen the need to go over a 1000 recipes to find on to ultimately make.

### Structure
The menu easily provides the quick glimpse of what recipes are available to their disposal.

### Surface
The black and nude scale color scheme was chosen to reflect the background of the name/story and create a sleek and modern feel. I wanted a user to have a sense of calm and ease as they 
navigated the pages.
