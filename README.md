## UX

### User stories
- As a subscriber looking for daily or weekly inspiration for a home cooked meal,
while battling busy schedules and family life, I would like to easily read a recipe.

- I often struggle to cut down the measurements of ingredients for a recipe that serves more than
one person. I would like the ability to reduce the serving number and automatically provide the
correct measurements.

- I hardly cook without a recipe, and when I do I never know what to pair certain foods with, 
I would appreciate a recipe that has an entire meal documented.

- As a user I would like the ability to online purchase the ingredients I need for the recipe, and
not have to worry about writing a list and going to my local grocery store.

- I'm new to cooking, I often have no idea what some of the ingredients are or what they look like,
often making it a mission for me to locate in a grocery store.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible for users searching for recipes to 
have a clean look with no clutter or information over load by having a user-friendly and minimalist
design.

### Scope
For the users i wanted to provide them with easy to read recipes that I have created, in a way lessen the need to go over a 1000 recipes to find on to ultimately make.

### Structure
The menu easily provides the quick glimpse of what recipes are available to their disposal.
